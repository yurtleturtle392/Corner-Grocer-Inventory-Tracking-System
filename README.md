For this project, I built an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer that processes daily text records of purchased items. The program reads a file listing items in chronological order and counts how many times each item appears, storing this information in a map. It then allows users to print all items, search for a specific item, display a histogram of item frequencies, and save the data to a backup file. This solution helps the Corner Grocer understand which items are purchased most frequently, allowing them to optimize their store layout and improve efficiency for both staff and customers.

I feel I did particularly well in designing the core functionality of the inventory system, ensuring that it accurately counts items and displays the information clearly. Implementing features like the histogram and search functions allowed me to practice mapping user input to data structures and handling searches. One area for potential improvement would be adding more error handling for file input and user input, which could make the program more secure and resilient against invalid or missing data. The most challenging part of the project was ensuring the program read the input file correctly while updating the map dynamically. I overcame this by breaking the problem down step by step, testing with small datasets, and using resources such as C++ documentation and example tutorials for file I/O and map usage. Skills developed in this project, including working with maps, file handling, loops, and functions, are highly transferable to other programming projects or coursework. I focused on writing maintainable and readable code by using clear function names, separating class definitions from implementations, and keeping logic modular, which makes the program adaptable for future enhancements or additional features.
